## Description
I made this project for the "Lower Danube" University of Galati's 2022 National Student Scientific Symposium, where I obtained 1st place.

## Origin
This project wasn't created from scratch by me. [Ray tracing courses from Scratchapixel](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/introduction-to-ray-tracing/how-does-it-work.html) and [ercang's GitHub repository](https://github.com/ercang/raytracer-js) served as significant sources of inspiration.

## Setting the project up
0. VS Code is the IDE I used to work on this project, thus I recommend using it.
1. In VS Code's terminal, write ```npm install --legacy-peer-deps``` to download all the necessary node modules.
2. After the node modules have been downloaded, write ```npm start``` to generate all the dist files and create a localhost server.

## Research and Presentation
See the papers I submitted to the jury and the PowerPoint I created to present it to an audience by accessing the files in the "papers" folder.
